# challenges-random

This repository consists of random code snippets either from challenges/exercises or interesting code snippets I've written. Every day or so I try to add a bit here or there with focus on classical problems (LCS, Subset Sum, Optimal Matrix Mult, etc) as well as trying new languages.

Source code is not divided into folders and sometimes execution instructions aren't given. (If I remember to) I'll always post tty commands to execute the code.
